# 🎲 Dice Game

A simple web-based dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Refresh the page or click the button to "roll" two dice and see which player wins.

## 🚀 How It Works

- Two dice are rolled on each refresh or button click.
- A random number between 1–6 is generated for each die.
- The images update accordingly, and the winner is displayed based on the higher roll.
